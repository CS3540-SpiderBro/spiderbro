Version

0.3.0 (Milestone 3)
Plan for Milestone 3

So far with Milestone 3 we have created a basic outline of the game with a somewhat detailed level. All features except some planned AI changes, general polishing and features from our play testing have been implemented. For Milestone 4, a large part of the development process will be implementing the nest module into the current spawning system and improving the AI. We may also add additional levels and a third attack option.
Plan for Milestone 4
List of features to be added:

    Improved enemy AI: attack/flee from player
    Player Health GUI
    Possibly add third person view for player option
    Add character attack 3 (web drop)
    Add additional levels
    Add 2 enemy types in addition to the current drones
    Implement an HP/Damage system, instead of insta kills
    Nest spawning system
    Complicated AI : see design doc
    Fixing Animations
    Additional Sounds/Noises
