Plan for Milestone 3
So far with Milestone 2 we have created a basic outline of the game with all major features functioning except for one major one: AI. As a result, developing the AI will be a large part of finishing Milestone 3. Milestone 3 will also include: developing attacks for 3 different enemy types, actual models for enemy units (instead of the cylinder), a new attack type for the player (web trap), more complicated spawning system, and a full bedroom map, we also plan to adjust additional features based on play testing.


List of features to be added:
Make scene look like a bedroom
Improved enemy AI: attack player
Player Health GUI
Possibly add third person view for player option
Add character attack 3 (web drop)
Add difficulty levels
